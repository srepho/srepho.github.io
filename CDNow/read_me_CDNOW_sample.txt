The file CDNOW_sample.txt contains the purchasing data for a 1/10th systematic sample of the CDNOW dataset originally used by Fader and Hardie (2001). (The master dataset contains the entire purchase history up to the end of June 1998 of the cohort of 23,570 individuals who made their first-ever purchase at CDNOW in the first quarter of 1997.) 

Each record in this file, 6919 in total, comprises five fields: the customer's ID in the master dataset, the customer's ID in the 1/10th sample dataset (ranging from 1 to 2357), the date of the transaction, the number of CDs purchased, and the dollar value of the transaction.

See the note "Creating an RFM Summary Using Excel" (http://brucehardie.com/notes/022/) for further details regarding this dataset.
